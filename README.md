# my-radio-software-setup

## Background

Although I'm a dedicated Apple OS X user, I've always kept an old Windows laptop around to maintain my ability to program my older Vertex VX-800 radio. It was a great rig but I needed a serial connector for the programming cable. Now that I can't get decent batteries for the VX-800, I've been forced to update my radios and I chose the ICOM F1000T. The side benefit is that the programming cable is USB.
